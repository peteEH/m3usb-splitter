# m3usb-splitter

tesla model 3 usb splitter

 -- splits a single usb port into a data only port (low power) and a charging power port
 -- option to provide either D+/D- short or a dedicated charging identification chip
 
 -- multiple PCB "variants" included, depends on the flash drive or cables used to attach to the splitter.
 
 
Tesla includes charging cables that short D+/D- together - these docking cables when used, properly idenify the usb source as a charging adaptor (USB spec)
 
 
Typical use case:

--- Samsung T5 500GB SSD plugs into the data port
--- included tesla charging cable for docking plugs into the power only port
